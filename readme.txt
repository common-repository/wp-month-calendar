== Description ==

A modified version of the Widget build in to WordPress. It displays a link for each month, not for each day.
That´s it more ore less... Ideal for blogs with a low post frequency. Includes all features of the original version,
incl. caching.
The Plugin uses the build in language files bundelt with WordPress and should work out of box in your language, if WordPress
is translated to this language (and it is probably ;))
